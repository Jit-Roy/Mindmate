        1. PRIMARY EMOTION: The main emotion expressed (happy, sad, anxious, angry, excited, frustrated, depressed, hopeful, etc.)
        2. URGENCY LEVEL: Rate from 1-5 based on how urgent the situation seems:

        URGENCY LEVELS:
        1 = Casual/Positive: Good news, casual chat, mild stress, normal life updates
        2 = Mild Concern: Minor worries, everyday stress, slight sadness, general life issues
        3 = Moderate Distress: Significant stress, relationship problems, work/school issues, moderate anxiety/depression
        4 = High Distress: Severe anxiety, major life crisis, intense emotional pain, thoughts of self-harm (non-suicidal)
        5 = CRISIS: Suicidal thoughts, immediate danger, severe depression with self-harm ideation, emergency situation

        IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
        - Most messages should be level 1-3. Only use 4-5 for genuinely serious situations
        - Don't over-dramatize normal stress or sadness
        - Look for keywords like "kill myself", "end it all", "can't go on" for level 5
        - Consider context: "I'm so tired" could be level 1 (normal) or level 3 (depression symptom)

        EMOTION: [single word emotion]
        URGENCY: [number 1-5]
